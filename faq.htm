							<span style="font-weight: 400">The Hancock County Registry of Deeds is located at
							50 State Street, Ellsworth ME 04605. The Registry is
							open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Monday through
							Friday, Except on State and National holidays.

							is a deed? </b><br>
							</font><span style="font-weight: 400"><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#333333">
							A deed is a written document by which the buyer
							obtains record title to real property. There are
							several types of deeds. The most common types in
							this area are Quitclaim or Warranty Deeds. In a
							Quitclaim Deed the owner states that he/she has not
							encumbered any debts or liens against the title but
							is unwilling to state that his/her predecessors did
							not do the same. In a warranty Deed the owner
							warrants that he/she has not encumbered any debts or
							liens against the title and guarantees that his/her
							predecessors did not encumber the title. <br>

							I lose my deed?</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#333333"><br>
							<span style="font-weight: 400">The primary evidence of ownership is the deed
							itself, but the recording of the deed at the
							Registry of Deeds is notice to the world as to
							ownership. Unrecorded deeds are legally binding on
							the persons who have knowledge of the deed but
							recorded deeds are absolute proof of ownership. Once
							recorded, the original deed is returned to the new
							owner who usually deposits it in a place of
							safekeeping with his or her important papers.
							However, if misplaced or lost, a copy may be
							obtained from the Registry of Deeds or on our
							website under the &quot;Search Public Records&quot; link on
							the top of the page. You may obtain a certified copy
							at the Registry of Deeds. The certified copy from
							the Registry has the same legal value as the
							original deed.<br>

							</b></font>
							<span style="font-weight: 400">
							<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#333333">The
							clerks at the Document Receiving Counter in the
							Registry of Deeds will help in answering any
							questions you may have. The clerks, however, are not
							attorneys and cannot give legal advice. They are
							willing, however, to give ministerial advice and
							assist you with your non-legal, registry related
							problems.<br>

							<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000080">May I
							make out my own deed?</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#333333"><br>
							<span style="font-weight: 400">Yes you may, but deeds are legally binding documents
							that affect the rights of the parties to the deed
							and also their heirs, successors and assignees.
							Knowledge of legal principles is very important in
							the preparation of a deed. The Registry is a
							recording agency and therefore, cannot make out
							deeds or answer those questions that pertain to
							legal matters. We advise you to consult a lawyer.<br>

							<span style="font-weight: 400">When any document is brought in to be recorded,
							there are a number of steps that are taken before it
							is returned to the concerned party. The information
							on the document is first abstracted into grantor and
							also grantee indices. The document is then scanned
							immediately. The images are then compared with the
							original document for accuracy. It is then made
							available on our public access system that can be
							accessed through our computers or on our website,
							<a href="http://www.hancockcountydeeds.com" style="text-decoration: none">

							<br>
							<span style="font-weight: 400">The State of Maine derives revenue from the sale of
							real estate through the sale of state tax stamps.
							The amount of the excise tax stamp differs from time
							to time depending on the action of the State General
							Court. In Hancock County, the seller, by custom, is
							obligated to pay for the amount of this stamp just
							as the buyer is accountable for paying the recording
							fee for the deed and/or mortgage. The money paid for
							the tax stamps is income to the Registry and is
							forwarded to the State of Maine Department of
							Revenue.<br>

							<font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#000080">What is
							a title search?</font></b><font face="Tahoma" size="2" color="#333333"><br>
							<span style="font-weight: 400">The recording of a deed and other documents in the
							Registry does not guaranty that the real estate is
							free from all liens, encumbrances and other legal
							problems that would cloud the ownership of the
							property. A Title Search is a review of all records
							(Deeds, Probate Court, Bankruptcy, Tax Liens, etc.)
							and a written report of the Title Searcher�s opinion
							as to the state of the record title issued. Some
							people do not have a Title Search, but that is a
							very dangerous practice and no bank will ever
							advance money for the realty without a Title Search.<br>

							<span style="font-weight: 400">The Registry has a section referred to as the
							Grantor and Grantee Index. Grantor means the seller
							and Grantee refers to the buyer. In order to locate
							your deed you are, for purposes of finding this
							deed, the Grantee, since you are the one who bought
							the property last. Once you ascertain the year that
							your property was purchased, you may use either the
							public access computers or Grantee books to find the
							book and page of your deed. There are specific
							instructions in the Registry on how to locate your
							deed by computer or Grantee books. The deed can also
							be found by accessing our website,
